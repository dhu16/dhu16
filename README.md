<h1 align='center'> Hi :grin:, I'm Daniel </h1>

<h3>
Hi, I am a Master's student at Columbia University studying computer science. I completed my undergrad at UCLA in spring 2022 where I studied cognitive science. 
</h3>

- I am interested in human-computer interaction and user interface design and development. 

- I currently work as a graduate research assistant at Columbia's Computer Graphics and User Interfaces Lab under Professor Steve Feiner, where I develop various sorts of user interfaces with Unity and in C#, which are deployed to mixed reality headsets for user exploration.
